I'm a career-changer with a diverse professional background spanning logistics, purchasing, and hospitality. Over the past few years, I’ve developed a growing passion for **Cybersecurity**, driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a desire to solve real-world digital threats.

While I don’t come from a traditional tech path, I bring a unique mix of discipline, problem-solving, and operational awareness from my previous roles — skills I now apply to labs, tools, and training environments focused on **SOC operations**, **incident response**, and **automation**.
