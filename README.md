I'm a career-changer with a diverse professional background spanning logistics, purchasing, and hospitality. Over the past few years, I’ve developed a growing passion for **Cybersecurity**, driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a desire to solve real-world digital threats.

While I don’t come from a traditional tech path, I bring a unique mix of discipline, problem-solving, and operational awareness from my previous roles — skills I now apply to labs, tools, and training environments focused on **SOC operations**, **incident response**, and **automation**.

My goal is clear: to transition into the cybersecurity field and grow as a **Security Analyst**, starting from a hands-on Tier 1 role where I can monitor threats, investigate alerts, and contribute to keeping systems secure.

## 🎯 Objective

To join a dynamic SOC team as a **Cybersecurity Analyst (Tier 1)** and actively contribute to protecting organizational assets while continuously learning and growing within the field of cybersecurity.
